### 3.1 Canonicalization

SMILES denotes a molecular structure as a graph with optional chiral
indications. This is essentially the two-dimensional picture chemists draw to
describe a molecule. SMILES describing only the labeled molecular graph (i.e.
atoms and bonds, but no chiral or isotopic information) are known as generic
SMILES. There are usually a large number of valid generic SMILES which
represent a given structure. A canonicalization algorithm exists to generate
one special generic SMILES among all valid possibilities; this special one is
known as the "unique SMILES". SMILES written with isotopic and chiral
specifications are collectively known as "isomeric SMILES". A unique isomeric
SMILES is known as an "absolute SMILES". See the following examples.

Input SMILES| Unique SMILES | OCC | CCO  
---|---  
[CH3][CH2][OH]  | CCO  
C-C-O | CCO  
C(O)C | CCO  
OC(=O)C(Br)(Cl)N | NC(Cl)(Br)C(=O)O   
ClC(Br)(N)C(=O)O | NC(Cl)(Br)C(=O)O   
O=C(O)C(N)(Br)Cl | NC(Cl)(Br)C(=O)O   
  
### 3.2 SMILES Specification Rules

SMILES notation consists of a series of characters containing no spaces.
Hydrogen atoms may be omitted (hydrogen-suppressed graphs) or included
(hydrogen-complete graphs). Aromatic structures may be specified directly or
in Kekule form.

There are five generic SMILES encoding rules, corresponding to specification
of atoms, bonds, branches, ring closures, and disconnections. Rules for
specifying various kinds of isomerism are discussed in the following section,
_ISOMERIC SMILES_.

#### 3.2.1 Atoms

Atoms are represented by their atomic symbols: this is the only required use
of letters in SMILES. Each non-hydrogen atom is specified independently by its
atomic symbol enclosed in square brackets, **[ ]**. The second letter of two-
character symbols must be entered in lower case. Elements in the "organic
subset" **B, C, N, O, P, S, F, Cl, Br,** and**I** may be written without
brackets if the _number of attached hydrogens conforms to the lowest normal
valence consistent with explicit bonds_. "Lowest normal valences" are B (3), C
(4), N (3,5), O (2), P (3,5), S (2,4,6), and 1 for the halogens. Atoms in
aromatic rings are specified by lower case letters, e.g., aliphatic carbon is
represented by the capital letter `**C**` , aromatic carbon by lower case
`**c**`. Since attached hydrogens are implied in the absence of brackets, the
following atomic symbols are valid SMILES notations.

**C** |  methane  |  (CH4)  
---|---|---  
**P** |  phosphine  |  (PH3)  
**N** |  ammonia  |  (NH3)  
**S** |  hydrogen sulfide  |  (H2S)  
**O** |  water  |  (H2O)  
**Cl** |  hydrochloric acid  |  (HCl)  
  
Atoms with valences other than "normal" and elements not in the "organic
subset" must be described in brackets.

[**S**]  |  elemental sulfur  
---|---  
[**Au**]  |  elemental gold  
  
Within brackets, any attached hydrogens and formal charges must always be
specified. The number of attached hydrogens is shown by the symbol **H**
followed by an optional digit. Similarly, a formal charge is shown by one of
the symbols **+** or **-** , followed by an optional digit. If unspecified,
the number of attached hydrogens and charge are assumed to be zero for an atom
inside brackets. Constructions of the form [Fe+++] are synonymous with the
form [Fe+3]. Examples are:

[**H+**]  |  proton   
---|---  
[**Fe+2**]  |  iron (II) cation   
[**OH-**]  |  hydroxyl anion   
[**Fe++**]  |  iron (II) cation   
[**OH3+**]  |  hydronium cation   
[**NH4+**]  |  ammonium cation   
  
#### 3.2.2 Bonds

Single, double, triple, and aromatic bonds are represented by the symbols -,
=, **#** , and :, respectively. Adjacent atoms are assumed to be connected to
each other by a single or aromatic bond (single and aromatic bonds may always
be omitted). Examples are:

**CC** | ethane  | (CH3CH3)  
---|---|---  
**C=O** | formaldehyde  | (CH2O)  
**C=C** | ethene  | (CH2=CH2)  
**O=C=O** | carbon dioxide  | (CO2)  
**COC** | dimethyl ether  | (CH3OCH3)  
**C#N** | hydrogen cyanide  | (HCN)  
**CCO** | ethanol  | (CH3CH2OH)  
**[H][H]** |  molecular hydrogen  | (H2)  
  
For linear structures, SMILES notation corresponds to conventional
diagrammatic notation except that hydrogens and single bonds are generally
omitted. For example, 6-hydroxy-1,4-hexadiene can be represented by many
equally valid SMILES, including the following three:

Structure| Valid SMILES |   | C=CCC=CCO  
---|---  
CH2=CH-CH2-CH=CH-CH2-OH  | C=C-C-C=C-C-O  
  | OCC=CCC=C  
  
#### 3.2.3 Branches

Branches are specified by enclosing them in parentheses, and can be nested or
stacked. In all cases, the implicit connection to a parenthesized expression
(a "branch") is to the left. Examples are:

|  |   
---|---|---  
CCN(CC)CC | CC(C)C(=O)O | C=CC(CCC)C(C(C)C)CCC  
**Triethylamine** | **Isobutyric acid** | **3-propyl-4-isopropyl-1-heptene**  
  
#### 3.2.4 Cyclic Structures

Cyclic structures are represented by breaking one bond in each ring. The bonds
are numbered in any order, designating ring opening (or ring closure) bonds by
a digit immediately following the atomic symbol at each ring closure. This
leaves a connected non-cyclic graph which is written as a non-cyclic structure
using the three rules described above. Cyclohexane is a typical example:  
  
---  
  
There are usually many different, but equally valid descriptions of the same
structure, e.g., the following SMILES notations for 1-methyl-3-bromo-
cyclohexene-1:  
  
---  
  
Many other notations may be written for the same structure, deriving from
different ring closures. SMILES does not have a preferred entry on input;
although (a) above may be simplest, others are just as valid.

A single atom may have more than one ring closure. This is illustrated by the
structure of cubane in which two atoms have more than one ring closure:  
  
---  
  
Generation of SMILES for cubane: **C12C3C4C1C5C4C3C25**.

If desired, digits denoting ring closures can be reused. As an example, the
digit 1 used twice in the specification:  
  
---  
O1CCCCC1N1CCCCC1  
  
The ability to re-use ring closure digits makes it possible to specify
structures with 10 or more rings. Structures that require more than 10 ring
closures to be open at once are exceedingly rare. If necessary or desired,
higher-numbered ring closures may be specified by prefacing a two-digit number
with percent sign (**%**). For example, **C2%13%24** is a carbon atom with a
ring closures 2, 13, and 24 .

#### 3.2.5 Disconnected Structures

Disconnected compounds are written as individual structures separated by a
"**.** " (period). The order in which ions or ligands are listed is arbitrary.
There is no implied pairing of one charge with another, nor is it necessary to
have a net zero charge. If desired, the SMILES of one ion may be imbedded
within another as shown in the example of sodium phenoxide.  
  
---  
  
Matching pairs of digits following atom specifications imply that the atoms
are bonded to each other. The bond may be explicit (bond symbol and/or
direction preceding the ring closure digit) or implicit (a nondirectional
single or aromatic bond). This is true whether or not the bond ends up as part
of a ring.

Adjacent atoms separated by dot (.) implies that the atoms are not bonded to
each other. This is true whether or not the atoms are in the same connected
component.

For example, **C1.C1** specifies the same molecule as `**CC**`(ethane)

### 3.3 Isomeric SMILES

This section describes the SMILES rules used to specify isotopism,
configuration about double bonds, and chirality. The term _isomeric SMILES_
collectively refers to SMILES written using these rules.

The SMILES isomer specification rules allow chirality to be completely
specified for any structure, if it is known. Unlike most existing chemical
nomenclatures such as CIP and IUPAC, these rules are also designed to allow
rigorous _partial_ specification of chirality. Aside from use in macros,
substructure searching, and other pattern matching operations, this is
important because much of the world's available chemical information is known
for structures with incompletely resolved chiralities (not all possible chiral
centers are separated, known, or reported).

All isomer specification rules in SMILES are therefore optional. The absence
of a specification for any attribute implies that the value of that attribute
is unspecified.

#### 3.3.1 Isotopic Specification

Isotopic specifications are indicated by preceding the atomic symbol with a
number equal to the desired integral atomic mass. An atomic mass can only be
specified inside brackets. For instance:

Smiles | Name | [**12C**]  | carbon-12  
---|---  
[**13C**]  | carbon-13  
[**C**] | carbon (unspecified mass)  
[**13CH4**] | C-13 methane  
  
#### 3.3.2 Configuration Around Double Bonds

Configuration around double bonds is specified by the characters **/** and
**\** which are "directional bonds" and can be thought of as kinds of single
or aromatic (eg. default) bonds. These symbols indicate relative
directionality between the connected atoms, and have meaning only when they
occur on both atoms which are double bonded. For instance, the following
SMILES are all valid for E- and Z-1,2-difluoroethene:

|  
---|---  
F/C=C/F | F/C=C\F  
F\C=C\F | F\C=C/F  
  
``An important difference between SMILES chirality conventions and others such
as CIP is that SMILES uses _local chirality_ representation (as opposed to
_absolute chirality_), which allows _partial_ specifications. An example of
this is illustrated below:

|  
---|---  
F/C=C/C=C/C | F/C=C/C=CC  
(completely specified) | (partially specified)  
  
#### 3.3.3. Configuration Around Tetrahedral Centers

SMILES uses a very general type of chirality specification based on local
chirality. Instead of using a rule-based numbering scheme to order neighbor
atoms of a chiral center, orientations are based on the order in which
neighbors occur in the SMILES string. As with all other aspects of SMILES, any
valid order is acceptable; the Daylight software is responsible for retaining
the meaning of the chiral specification when the structure is modified or
rearranged (e.g. to make the unique SMILES).

The simplest and most common kind of chirality is tetrahedral; four neighbor
atoms are evenly arranged about a central atom, known as the "chiral center".
If all four neighbors are different from each other in any way, mirror images
of the structure will not be identical. The two mirror images are known as
"enantiomers" and are the only two forms that a tetrahedral center can have.
If two (or more) of the four neighbors are identical to each other, the
central atom will not be chiral (its mirror images can be superimposed in
space).

In SMILES, tetrahedral centers may be indicated by a simplified chiral
specification (`@` or `@@`) written as an atomic property following the atomic
symbol of the chiral atom. If a chiral specification is not present for a
chiral atom, its chirality is implicitly not specified. For instance:

|  
---|---  
NC(C)(F)C(=O)O | N[C@](C)(F)C(=O)O  
NC(F)(C)C(=O)O | N[C@@](F)(C)C(=O)O  
(unspecified chirality) | (specified chirality)  
  
Looking _from_ the amino `N` _to_ the chiral `C` (as the SMILES is written),
the three other neighbors appear anticlockwise in the order that they are
written in the top SMILES, `N[C@](C)(F)C(=O)O` (methyl-C, F, carboxy-C), and
clockwise in the bottom one, `N[C@@](F)(C)C(=O)O`. The symbol "`@`" indicates
that the following neighbors are listed anticlockwise (it is a "visual
mnemonic" in that the symbol looks like an anticlockwise spiral around a
central circle). "`@@`" indicates that the neighbors are listed clockwise (you
guessed it, anti-anti-clockwise).

If the central carbon is not the very first atom in the SMILES and has an
implicit hydrogen attached (it can have at most one and still be chiral), the
implicit hydrogen is taken to be the first neighbor atom of the three
neighbors that follow a tetrahedral specification. If the central carbon is
first in the SMILES, the implicit hydrogen is taken to be the "from" atom.
Hydrogens may always be written explicitly (as `[H]`) in which case they are
treated like any other atom. In each case, the _implied order is exactly as
written in SMILES_. Some of the valid SMILES for the alanine are:

|  
---|---  
N[C@@]([H])(C)C(=O)O | N[C@]([H])(C)C(=O)O  
N[C@@H](C)C(=O)O | N[C@H](C)C(=O)O  
N[C@H](C(=O)O)C  | N[C@@H](C(=O)O)C  
[H][C@](N)(C)C(=O)O | [H][C@@](N)(C)C(=O)O  
[C@H](N)(C)C(=O)O | [C@@H](N)(C)C(=O)O  
  
``The chiral order of the ring closure bond is implied by the lexical order
that the ring closure digit appears _on the chiral atom_(not in the lexical
order of the "substituent" atom).  
  
---  
C[C@H]1CCCCO1  
**or**  
O1CCCC[C@@H]1C  
  
#### 3.3.4 General Chiral Specification

There are many kinds of chirality other than tetrahedral. The use of the "`@`"
symbol described above is actually a special case of a general chiral
specification syntax.

The general chiral specification used in SMILES has three parts: the `@`
symbol, followed by a two-letter chiral class indicator, followed by a
numerical chiral permutation designator. A default chiral class is assigned to
each degree (number of connections); the default class for four connections is
tetrahedral (TH). Most chiralities have more than two possible choices; the
choices are assigned from a table numerically. In most cases, the `@1`
designation means "anticlockwise around the axis represented by SMILES order"
and `@2` means "clockwise". Notations in the form "`@@`" and "`@@@`" are
interpreted as "`@`2" and "`@`3" (analogous to "`+++`" meaning "`+3`"). The
"`@`" and "`@@`" notations used above are shortcuts for the full
specifications "`@TH1`" and "`@TH2`". In practice, full chiral specifications
are not often needed.

SMILES handles the full range of chiral specification, including resolution of
"reduced chirality" (where the number of enantiomers is reduced by symmetry)
and "degenerate chirality" (where the center becomes non-chiral due to
symmetrical substitution). As with other aspects of SMILES, the language
guarantees the ability to specify exactly what is known, including partial
specifications. The SMILES system will generate unique isomeric SMILES for any
given specification, and substructure recognition will operate correctly on
all types of chirality.

The rest of this section will be limited to discussing the following
chiralities: tetrahedral, allene-like, square-planar, trigonal-bipyramidal,
and octahedral. Although many more chiral classes can be handled by this
system (it's table-driven), these five classes are very common in chemistry
and cover most of the issues to be encountered in the remainder.

_Tetrahedral_. The tetrahedral class symbol is `TH`. This is the default
chiral class for degree four. Possible values are 1 and 2. `@TH1` (or just
`@`) indicates that, looking from the first connected atom, the following
three connected atoms are listed anticlockwise; `@TH2` (or `@@`) indicates
clockwise.

_Allene-like_. The allene-like class symbol is `AL`. This is the default
chiral class for degree 2 (the chiral center is the central atom with two
double bonds). Although substituted `C=C=C` structures are most common,
`C=C=C=C=C` structures are also allene-like, as are any odd number of serially
double-bonded atoms. Possible values are `@AL1` (or just `@`) and `@AL2` (or
`@@`); these are interpreted by superimposing the substituted atoms and
evaluating as per tetrahedral. Hydrogens attached to substituted allene-like
atoms are taken to be immediately following that atom, as shown below:

|  
---|---  
OC(Cl)=[C@]=C(C)F | OC=[C@]=CF  
OC(Cl)=[C@AL1]=C(C)F | OC([H])=[C@AL1]=C([H])F  
  
**Square-planar.** The square-planar class symbol is **SP** Possible values
are `@SP1`, `@SP2`, and `@SP3`; this is not the default chiral class for
degree four, so shorthand specifications are not allowed. Square-planar is
also somewhat unusual in that the ideas of clockwise and anticlockwise do not
apply.

|  
---|---  
F[Po@SP1](Cl)(Br)I | (SP1 lists in a "U shape")  
F[Po@SP2](Br)(Cl)I | (SP2 lists in a "4-shape")  
F[Po@SP3](Cl)(I)Br | (SP3 lists in a "Z shape")  
  
**Trigonal-bipyramidal**. The trigonal-bipyramidal class symbol is TB. This is
the default chiral class for degree five. Possible values are `@TB1` to
`@TB20`. `@TB1` (or just `@`) indicates that, when the SMILES is listed from
one axial connection to the other, the three intermediate, equatorially-
connected atoms are listed anticlockwise; `@TB2` (or `@@`) indicates
clockwise. This is illustrated below.  
  
---  
s[As@@](F)(Cl)(Br)C=O  
O=C[As@](F)(Cl)(Br)S  
  
**Octahedral**. The octahedral class symbol is `OH`. This is the default
chiral class for degree six. Possible values are `@OH1` to `@OH30`. `@OH1` (or
just `@`) indicates that, when the SMILES is listed from one axial connection
to the other, the four intermediate, equatorially-connected atoms are listed
anticlockwise; `@OH2` (or `@@`) indicates clockwise. This is illustrated
below.  
  
---  
S[Co@@](F)(Cl)(Br)(I)C=O  
O=C[Co@](F)(Cl)(Br)(I)S  
  
### 3.4 SMILES Conventions

Aside from the above rules, a small number of conventions are universally used
in SMILES. These are briefly discussed below; for more detail, see the JCICS
paper (_ibid_).

#### 3.4.1 Hydrogens

Hydrogen atoms do not normally need to be specified when writing SMILES for
most organic structures. The presence of hydrogens may be specified in three
ways:

  * Implicitly.....for atoms specified without brackets, from normal valence assumptions.  

  * Explicitly by count.....inside brackets, by the hydrogen count supplied; zero if unspecified.  

  * As explicit atoms.....as [H] atoms.

There is no distinction between "organic" and "inorganic" SMILES nomenclature.
One may specify the number of attached hydrogens for any atom in any SMILES.
For example, propane may be entered as `[CH3][CH2][CH3]` instead of `CCC`.

There are four situations where specification of explicit hydrogen
specification is required:

  * charged hydrogen, i.e. a proton, `[H+]`;  

  * hydrogens connected to other hydrogens, e.g., molecular hydrogen, `[H][H]`;  

  * hydrogens connected to other than one other atom, e.g., bridging hydrogens; and  

  * isotopic hydrogen specifications, e.g. in heavy water, `[2H]O[2H]`. 

#### 3.4.2 Aromaticity

Aromaticity must be deduced in a system such as SMILES which generates an
unambiguous chemical nomenclature because of the fundamental requirement to
characterize the symmetry of a molecule. Given effective aromaticity-detection
algorithms, it is not necessary to enter any structure as aromatic if the user
prefers to enter an aliphatic (Kekule-like) structure. Entering structures as
aromatic directly (i.e., by using lower case atomic symbols) provides a
shortcut to accurate chemical specification and is closer to the mental
molecular model used by most chemists.

The SMILES algorithm uses an extended version of Hueckel's rule to identify
aromatic molecules and ions. To qualify as aromatic, all atoms in the ring
must be sp2 hybridized and the number of available "excess" p-electrons must
satisfy Hueckel's 4N+2 criterion. As an example, benzene is written
`c1ccccc1`, but an entry of `C1=CC=CC=C1` \- cyclohexatriene, the Kekule form
- leads to detection of aromaticity and results in an internal structural
conversion to aromatic representation. Conversely, entries of `c1ccc1` and
`c1ccccccc1` will produce the correct anti-aromatic structures for
cyclobutadiene and cyclooctatetraene, `C1=CC=C1` and `C1=CC=CC=CC=C1`. In such
cases the SMILES system looks for a structure that preserves the implied sp2
hybridization, the implied hydrogen count, and the specified formal charge, if
any. Some inputs, however, may not only be incorrect but also impossible, such
as `c1cccc1`. Here `c1cccc1` cannot be converted to `C1=CCC=C1` since one of
the carbon atoms would be sp3 with two attached hydrogens. In such a structure
alternating single and double bond assignments cannot be made. The SMILES
system will flag this as an "impossible" input. Please note that only atoms on
the following list can be considered aromatic: C, N, O, P, S, As, Se, and *
(wildcard). In addition, exocyclic double bonds do not break aromaticity.

|  |   
---|---|---  
C1=COC=C1 | C1=CN=C[NH]C(=O)1 | C1=C*=CC=C1  
c1cocc1 | c1cnc[nH]c(=O)1 | c1c*ccc1  
  
It is important to remember that the purpose of the SMILES aromaticity
detection algorithm is for the purposes of chemical information representation
only! To this end, rigorous rules are provided for determining the
"aromaticity" of charged, heterocyclic, and electron-deficient ring systems.
The "aromaticity" designation as used here is not intended to imply anything
about the reactivity, magnetic resonance spectra, heat of formation, or odor
of substances.

#### 3.4.3 Aromatic Nitrogen Compounds

A short note is in order about aromatic nitrogens, a common source of
confusion in chemical information systems. All three common types of aromatic
nitrogen may be specified with the aromatic nitrogen symbol `**n**`.
Archetypical examples are pyridine, pyridine-N-oxide, and pyrrole.

|  |   
---|---|---  
n1ccccc1 | O=n1ccccc1   [O-][n+]1ccccc1 | Cn1cccc1    [nH]1cccc1  
**Pyridine** | **Pyridine-N-oxide** | **Methyl and 1H-pyrrole**  
  
Note that the pyrrolyl nitrogen in 1H-pyrrole is written [nH] to distinguish
this kind of nitrogen from a pyridyl-N. Alternative valid SMILES for
1H-pyrrole include `[H]n1cccc1` (with explicit hydrogen) and `N1C=CC=C1`
(aliphatic form) all three input forms are equivalent.

#### 3.4.4 Bonding Conventions

_SMILES does not dictate which valence conventions should be used to model
molecular structure_. In fact, an advantage of using SMILES is its ability to
describe various valence models of the same structure. Atoms may be connected
and show charge separation as desired. For instance, nitromethane can be
represented in SMILES as `CN(=O)=O` or as the charge separated `C[N+](=O)[O-]`
(we tend to use the former for database work because it preserves symmetry).
Both are "right" in the sense that they represent different, useful models of
the substance. In general, when symmetry is not an issue, most chemists prefer
charge-separated structures if they can avoid representing atoms in unusual
valence states, e.g., diazomethane is written as `C=[N+]=[N-]` rather than
`C=[N]=[N]`.

Given one valence model of a structure, chemical database systems such as THOR
and Merlin have the ability to retrieve data about that structure even if the
data were stored under a different valence model of the structure. With such
systems, the choice of valence conventions is not critical to either database
design nor database query.

#### 3.4.5 Tautomers

Tautomeric structures are explicitly specified in SMILES. There are no
"tautomeric bond", "mobile hydrogen", nor "mobile charge" specifications.
Selection of one or all tautomeric structures is left to the user and strongly
depends on the application. Given one tautomeric form, most chemical
information systems will report data for all known tautomers if needed. The
role of SMILES is to specify exactly which tautomeric form is requested, and
for which there are data. A simple example, with two possible tautomeric
forms, is shown below:  
  
---  
O=c1[nH]cccc1         Oc1ncccc1  
**2-pyridone**                 **2-pyridinol**  
  
### 3.5 Extensions for Reactions

The SMILES language is extended to handle reactions. There are two areas where
SMILES is extended: distinguishing component parts of a reactions and atom
maps.

Component parts of a reaction are handled by introducing the ">" character as
a new separator. Any reaction must have exactly two > characters in it. ">>"
is a valid reaction SMILES for an empty reaction. Each of the ">"-separated
components of a reaction must be a valid molecule SMILES.

As an aside, molecule SMILES never have a ">" character. In a program, one can
quickly determine if a SMILES refers to a reaction or molecule by searching
for a ">" character in the string.

**Reaction SMILES Grammar:**

    
    
    reaction		:	reactant '>' agent '>' product
    			|	reactant '>>' product
    			;
    reactant,
    agent,
    product			:	molecule
                            |       <null>
    			;
    molecule		:	SMILES
    			;
    
    
    
    SMILES:  a valid molecule specification in the SMILES language.
    

For example:

**C=CCBr >>C=CCI**      This is a valid reaction. Note that there are no agent
molecules. Also note that several atoms are missing from the reaction (the
product "Br" and the reactant "F").

**[I-].[Na+].C=CCBr >>[Na+].[Br-].C=CCI**      This is a more complete version
of the same reaction. It has been canonicalized. It would form the root of a
datatree when stored in a THOR database.

**C=CCBr.[Na+].[I-] >CC(=O)C>C=CCI.[Na+].[Br-]**      This version of the
reaction includes an agent. Note that the SMILES does not indicate how the
agent participates. Whether the agent is a solvent, catalyst, or performs
another function within the reaction must be stored separately as data. This
SMILES could be stored in a THOR database as an absolute SMILES and would
appear on the same datatree page as the previous example.

In the above example, note that the reaction is ambiguous with respect to the
carbon atoms involved. One might assume that a normal Sn2 displacement is
occurring. In fact, an equally reasonable allylic displacement is possible,
via either an Sn1-like allyl cation. Recognize that the reaction SMILES given
above do not say which carbons are which and hence do not discriminate between
the two alternate mechanisms.

This case demonstrates the use and need for atom maps for reaction processing.
Atom maps are used primarily to further define the overall reaction in cases
where the reaction mechanism may not be evident from the reactant and product
molecules. Atom maps are non-negative integer atom modifiers. They follow the
":" character within an atom expression. They must be the last modifier within
the atom expression:

**SMILES Atom Expression Grammar:**

    
    
    atom     		:	SYMBOL
    			|	[ WEIGHT SYMBOL mods ]
    			|	[ WEIGHT SYMBOL mods : CLASS ]
    			;
    mods                    :       mod mods
    			;
    mod                     :       HCOUNT | CHARGE | CHIRAL
     			;
    
    
    
    CLASS = non-negative integer class value.
    WEIGHT = atomic weight.
    SYMBOL = atomic symbol.
    HCOUNT = Atom hydrogen count specification.
    CHARGE = Atom charge specification.
    CHIRAL = Atom chirality specification.
    

Atom maps are an _atomic_ property. They can legally appear in a SMILES for
any atom, whether or not it is part of a reaction. Atom with atom map labels
in a molecule SMILES are considered valid; the atom maps are ignored for
molecule processing. Absolute and unique SMILES generated by the system for
molecules never include atom maps.

Finally, there are some differences in the handling of atom maps and agent
components in the _unique_ versus _absolute_ SMILES for reactions. Atom maps
and agent components are not part of the unique SMILES specification. This is
important for the THOR database, where the datatree roots are formed from the
unique SMILES. The net result is that each reaction datatree may contain
multiple specific reactions with different agents and atom maps.

#### 3.5.1 Reaction Atom Maps

Atom mappings are properties of the atoms in the reaction molecules. The
mappings represent equivalence classes of atoms within a reaction. In effect,
the map tells the computer which atoms are the same on the reactant and
products sides of a reaction. Without this map information, it is difficult to
derive the reaction bond changes which occur.

Within the SMILES language, atom maps are represented as a non-negative
numeric atom modifier following the ":" character (e.g. [CH3:2] is a carbon in
class 2).

Within the Daylight toolkit, the atom maps are manipulated as sets of mapped
atoms. The atom map class numbers which are used in SMILES do not appear in
the toolkit interface to a reaction. The map class numbers in SMILES do not
have any additional significance, except to associate all atoms with the same
map class label to one another.

There are no requirements for completeness or uniqueness of the atom mappings.
Atom mappings are independent of the connectivity and properties of the
underlying molecules. This is so for several reasons: first, there are limits
to the valence representation of molecules which appear when processing
reactions. For example the oxygens in sodium acetate (CC(=O)[O-].[Na+]) are
chemically indistinguishable, even though the valence model used in the
toolkit requires that they be connected differently. Some systems (CAS, for
example) recognize this equivalence in their structural representation (the
tautomer bond). It is often useful to map these to the same class for reaction
purposes: **[CH3:1][C:2](=[O:3])[O-:3].[Na+:4]**

A second case is where there is ambiguity in a reaction mechanism which one
wants to express:

can undergo a cope rearrangement before reaction (which yields the same
molecule graph). In effect, there are two distinct mechanisms by which the
product is produced. This can be expressed as part of a reaction by:
**[CH2:1]=[CH:2][CH2:1][CH2:3][C:4](C)[CH2:3]**

A third case is simply a lack of information about the reaction itself. It
should be possible to omit some atom maps or specify partial information for
sets of atoms which *might* end up in a given position in the product. It is
never acceptable to force a user to make up data in order to register a
reaction. One should only store exactly what is known about the reaction. Atom
maps are, by definition ambiguous with respect to the underlying molecules.
Atom maps do not appear in the lexical representation of a unique SMILES. They
do appear in the lexical representation of an absolute SMILES.

Finally, atom maps are arbitrary class designations; the values of the numbers
have no meaning. The Daylight system reserves the right to change the class
numbers upon canonicalization of a reaction. The system will reorder the atom
map classes over the entire reaction during canonicalization. The resulting
maps are guaranteed to have the same meaning as the reaction before
canonicalization. Practically, the maps are renumbered as small, dense
integers in canonical atom order, but this is not guaranteed. Also, during
canonicalization, the atom map classes for agent atoms are removed.

#### 3.5.2 Hydrogens

Hydrogens in reactions are handled as with molecules; they are suppressed
unless "special". Recall that for molecules, hydrogens are special if they
are: charged, isotopic, bonded to another hydrogen, or multiply bonded. With
reactions, there is an additional case which will make a hydrogen special. It
is often desirable (eg. 1,5-hydride shift) to store information about the
location of hydrogens as part of the atom map of a reaction. Hydrogens with a
supplied atom map are considered "special" and these hydrogens are not
suppressed. These mapped hydrogens appear explicitly in Absolute SMILES for
reactions. Otherwise, atom-mapped hydrogens do not appear in Unique SMILES.
