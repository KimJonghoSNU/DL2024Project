Task: Convert the given molecular description into its corresponding SMILES representation. Think step by step to identify the correct SMILES string.
```
Description: The molecule is a phenylenediamine in which the amino functions are at positions 1 and 4 of the benzene nucleus. It has a role as a hapten, a dye, a reagent and an allergen. Think step by step.
```
Reasoning: 
1. The molecule is described as a phenylenediamine, indicating a benzene ring with two amino (-NH2) groups attached.
2. The description specifies that the amino groups are located at positions 1 and 4 on the benzene ring, which means they are opposite each other (para-position).
3. The SMILES notation for a benzene ring is "C1=CC=CC=C1". Adding amino groups at positions 1 and 4 results in "C1=CC(=CC=C1N)N", where "N" denotes the amino group.

SMILES: C1=CC(=CC=C1N)N

Description: The molecule is a member of the class of pterocarpans carrying two hydroxy substituents at positions 6a and 9 as well as prenyl and methoxy substituents at positions 2 and 3 respectively. It has a role as a plant metabolite. It is a member of pterocarpans, a member of phenols and an aromatic ether. Think step by step.
```
Reasoning:
The molecule belongs to the pterocarpan class, characterized by a fused aromatic system with specific substituents.
Two hydroxy (-OH) groups are attached at positions 6a and 9.
A prenyl group (-CH2CH=C(CH3)2) is attached at position 2, contributing to the chain branching.
A methoxy group (-OCH3) is at position 3.
The stereochemistry at key positions (noted as @@ or @ in SMILES) is essential for capturing the correct chiral centers.
Combining the structural components with proper stereochemistry and functional groups yields the SMILES:
SMILES: CC(=CCC1=CC2=C(C=C1OC)OC[C@@]3([C@H]2OC4=C3C=CC(=C4)O)O)C
```
Finalize your answer only with the SMILES string, without any additional information.

CC(=CCC1=CC2=C(C=C1OC)OC[C@@]3([C@H]2OC4=C3C=CC(=C4)O)O)C
```
Description: The molecule is a cyclopentapyran that is 7-deoxyloganin with a methyl and hydrogen replaced by hydroxy and hydroxymethyl groups at position 7. It has a role as a metabolite. It is a beta-D-glucoside, a cyclopentapyran, an enoate ester, a monosaccharide derivative, a methyl ester and a tertiary alcohol. It derives from a 7-deoxyloganin. Think step by step.
```
The molecule is derived from 7-deoxyloganin, which is a cyclopentapyran structure with a characteristic bicyclic ring system.
At position 7, the description indicates a hydroxy group (-OH) and a hydroxymethyl group (-CH2OH) replacing the original methyl and hydrogen. These substitutions are critical for identifying the modified structure.
The molecule is described as a beta-D-glucoside, indicating the presence of a beta-linked glucose molecule attached to the core structure. This glucose unit has hydroxyl groups at multiple positions, with a hydroxymethyl group (-CH2OH) at the terminal position.
The core structure includes a methyl ester (-COOCH3) and an enoate ester group as part of the molecule. These are typical functional groups for derivatives of 7-deoxyloganin.
The description specifies stereochemistry through terms like beta-D-glucoside and mentions chirality at various positions in the cyclopentapyran ring system. The stereochemistry is explicitly captured using @@ or @ in SMILES notation.
Combining Structural Information:
By integrating the base structure of 7-deoxyloganin, functional group modifications, glycosidic linkage, and stereochemistry, the complete SMILES for the molecule is determined.
